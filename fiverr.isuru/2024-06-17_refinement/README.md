## Message

Hi Isuru,

Thank you very much for the great work, I really like it! The rotation is in there, the point of view, the repositionion of the legs. Even the shiny color of the metals the statue is made of is well reflected! This was intended to be my first response, but was deleted after the revision request (now above).

I just have some details that would be great if they could be refined. The mentioned example images are attached below:

Thanks a lot!
